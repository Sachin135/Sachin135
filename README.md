<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Sachin Khanna</h1>
<h3 align="center">I am a Computer Engineering student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a strong focus on low-latency digital system design, particularly across FPGA and ASIC development, computer architecture, AI acceleration, and embedded systems. My technical interests center on hardware/software co-design, RTL design and verification using SystemVerilog, VHDL, and UVM, and architecting platforms optimized for real-time, latency-critical workloads. I am driven to design and deliver high-performance digital systems that push the boundaries of efficiency, scalability, and speed.</h3>
